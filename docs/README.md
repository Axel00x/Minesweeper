# Minesweeper

Basic version of the famous minesweeper game playable on the terminal.

## Features

The game is still in its basic version and only contains the following features:

- Random generation of mines (no guarantee of winning as they are generated randomly and there is no control over the randomisation)
- Customisable number of columns and rows
- Customisable number of mines

### Future updates

Note: the game was created to review some basic concepts of Python, so it is not a project that will continue for long but will only get a few more updates and maybe even a graphic version, who knows ;)
